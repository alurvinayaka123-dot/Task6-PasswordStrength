# 🔐 Cyber Security Internship – Task 6
## Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

This repository contains the submission for **Task 6: Password Complexity & Strength Evaluation**.

## 📌 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong by creating different passwords and testing them with online password strength tools.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Online entropy / crack-time estimators

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Created several example passwords:
   - Simple short password
   - Moderate password (mixed case + numbers)
   - Strong passphrase (long phrase with symbols)
2. Entered each password into an online password strength checker.
3. Recorded:
   - Score / strength level
   - Estimated crack time
   - Feedback / suggestions.
4. Compared results to identify what factors most improve strength:
   - Length
   - Variety of characters
   - Avoiding dictionary words and patterns.
5. Summarised best practices and key learnings in the report.

## 📝 Summary
The task shows how length and randomness greatly increase password security and why strong, unique passwords (or passphrases) plus multi-factor authentication are essential.
