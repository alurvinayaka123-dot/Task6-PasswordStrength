# Password Strength Evaluation – Report (Sample)

## 1. Passwords Tested (examples)
1. `vinayaka123` – short, predictable.
2. `V!nay@ka2024` – mixed case, digits and symbols.
3. `Blue_Elephants_dance!2024` – long passphrase with symbols and digits.

## 2. Tool Feedback (example summary)
- Weak password: low score, easily guessed by dictionary / brute force.
- Medium password: better but still crackable with time.
- Strong passphrase: very high score, estimated crack time “centuries”.

## 3. Best Practices Learned
- Use **at least 12–16 characters**, longer is better.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid:
  - Names, birthdays, phone numbers.
  - Common words or keyboard patterns (`123456`, `qwerty`).
- Prefer **unique passwords per site** and store them in a password manager.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.

## 4. Conclusion
Password complexity (especially length and randomness) significantly affects resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks. Strong passphrases combined with MFA provide much higher protection than short, simple passwords.
